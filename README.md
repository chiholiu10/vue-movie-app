VueJs: The reason why choosing this framework is because of the flat learning curve. Besides that, the small size of the app is also one of the benefit to use Vuejs. High performance makes UX also feel more smoothly.

Jest: In order to test the component individual I choose Jest testing which is a very famous testing with good documentation.

TypeScript: Because the typings can be checked properly and it makes debugging much easier. Also as a programming you must think about the right typings which can not always be checked beforehand.

Resetcss: which helps the developer to remove all weird padding spaces and so on. This helps to design stuff much easier.

SCSS

Husky: which test, run build and do the linting stuff to check if there are errors before commiting. This helps to avoid for instance failed CI CD Pipelin

CI CD Pipeline: To double check if the application can smoothly build the app.

Linter: to check all the errors and create consistency in stuff like indentation

Prettier:

How to run app:

Git clone: url
npm i or npm install
npm run dev

[] Please create a readme file that explains your architectural decisions (E.G. why did
you choose a specific framework) and make sure you include instructions on how to run your solution
[] Please make sure that UI is simple yet eye-catching
