### Vue3

The reason why choosing this framework is because of the flat learning curve. Besides that, the small size of the app is also one of the benefit to use Vuejs. High performance makes UX also feel more smoothly.

### Vue/test-utils

Official utility library for Vue.js. It allows you to mount a component without rendering its child components.

### Eslint

Makes code style consistent, avoids errors, and improves code quality.

### Eslint-plugin-vue

Allows to check the `<template>` and `<script>` of .vue files with ESLint as well as Vue code in .js files. It will for instance find wrong use of Vue.js Directives (v-html, v-show, v-if, v-else, v-for and so on) and violation of Vue.js Style Guide (always use key with v-for or never use v-if in same element with v-for).

### Happy-dom

The goal of Happy DOM is to emulate enough of a web browser to be useful for testing, scraping web sites and server-side rendering.

### Resetcss:

Which helps the developer to remove all weird padding spaces and so on. This helps to design stuff much easier.

### Husky

Linting stuff to check if there are errors before commiting.

### Linter

To check all the errors and create consistency in stuff like indentation.

### Prettier

The biggest benefit for Prettier for us was being able to format the entire code base at once.

### SASS

Helps write clean, easy and less css. For designers and developer easy to work more efficiently and quickly.

### Vite:

Is really fast, because it doesn't need to rebuild the whole bundle when something changes.

### Vitest:

Is a blazing fast unit test framework powered by Vite.
